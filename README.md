<h1>Hi there, internet community!👋</h1>

<p>
My name is Mariel Teune and I recently completed coding bootcamp and am excited to see what I can build with my newly acquired skills. I am an entrepreneur with a speciality in international marketing and trade, as well as a mother of three littles. Fun fact: 📷 I am also a professional photographer! Check out my work at: <a href="http://lumikhastudio.com/">www.lumikhastudio.com</a>
</p>

<p>
I am passionate about projects involving: 
<br>
🌱 sustainable & accessible agriculture
<br>
🌍 international development, trade & economics
<br>
👦 early childhood education & financial literacy
<br>
⚕️ public & mental health
<br>
💻 technology & ethics.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time, you can find me searching for the perfect family getaway, hiking, taking photos, gardening, testing new recipes with my garden harvest and spending time with my favorite people.
